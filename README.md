# Mini Youtube
An extension that makes YouTube video float while you're reading/writing comments so you can do both at the same time.
The floating screen is resizable and can be dragged and placed anywhere on the screen.

## Chrome
Download it on the [Chrome Web Store](http://goo.gl/TyNOlF)

## Edge
1. [Download the latest zip](https://github.com/japborst/miniyoutube/archive/master.zip)
2. Extract the zip file somewhere safe (it will need to remain there as long as you use the extension)
3. Browse to `about:flags` in Edge and turn on the option `Enable extension developer features`
4. Restart your browser
5. Go to Extensions in the browser menu and click `Load extension`
6. Select the `miniyoutube-master` folder you extracted earlier

Edge disables side-loaded extensions whenever you restart the browser, unfortunately. However after a few seconds you will get a prompt to re-enable them with a single click.
